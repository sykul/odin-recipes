    <h2>Description</h2>
    The lasagne recipe is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of delicious flavors and textures. This hearty and comforting dish starts with a rich meat sauce made with ground beef, onions, garlic, crushed tomatoes, and aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. The sauce simmers to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld together. Meanwhile, lasagne noodles are cooked until al dente and drained. The assembly begins with a layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of tender lasagne noodles. The noodles are then topped with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. This layering process is repeated, creating a delectable tower of flavors. Finally, the lasagne is baked in the oven until golden and bubbling, resulting in a mouthwatering dish that is sure to impress. Allow the lasagne to cool slightly before serving, and savor each bite of this comforting and satisfying Italian classic.
