    <h2>Description</h2>
    Transport yourself to Italy with a slice of Tiramisu, a decadent and luscious dessert that delights the senses. Layers of delicate ladyfinger cookies are delicately soaked in coffee and liqueur, if desired, creating a moist and flavorful base. These coffee-infused cookies are then layered with a velvety mixture of mascarpone cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract, resulting in a creamy and indulgent filling. To finish, a dusting of cocoa powder adds a touch of bitterness and elegance. Refrigerated to perfection, each bite of Tiramisu offers a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, making it the perfect finale to any meal.    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
